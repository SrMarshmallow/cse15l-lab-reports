I learned how to set up a server and how to interact with it from a browser using a url. Specifically, I learned how to use unique ports to open a server and how to change the path on a url to carry out specific commands such as /increment and /add as a query. This further helped me understand the structure of urls and how websites use the information embedded in them to carry out specific functions.
